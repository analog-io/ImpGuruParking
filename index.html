<p>Over the past year it has been my distinct pleasure to provide a free and easy to use plotting tool for your data.sparkfun.com data streams.  Recently I have been notified that ninefold.com, our hosting site, has discontinued the Ruby on Rails hosting services that enabled Imp.Guru to be available.  Due to this transition, I have made the hard decision to also discontinue imp.guru as a service and instead focus on a new solution that has more functionality and features.  This service is called <a href="https://analog.io">analog.io</a> and it is available today.  You may <a href="https://analog.io/users/sign_up">Sign up for analog.io here</a>.</p>

I'm very greatful for the success that imp.guru has been and most importanly the users who have made it come to life!  I hope to continue this tradition with the analog.io community! <br>
<br>Sincerely,<br>Luke Beno<br>Site Creator<br><br>
